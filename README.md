# The MI Diaries Research Framework (or MiDRF for short)

MiDRF is a suite of open source and ready-to-use research tools, including a browser-based corpus management tool and an app-builder website for creating Android and iOS mobile apps for data collection. MiDRF was created by and for the [MI Diaries Project](https://mi-diaries.org) as a user-friendly interface for collecting speech data and generating transcripts for linguistic analysis, but MiDRF has been built to be configurable to meet the needs of a wide range of projects. The code and documentation for MiDRF has been developed with the goals of being easy for any researcher or educator to configure, deploy, and use, without requiring much IT support. 

More detailed information about MiDRF can be found on [this repo's Wiki](https://github.com/midiaries/datahub/wiki), which includes the sections described below.
